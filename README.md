Simple-3D-Software-Render
=========================

Simple software render implemented by Ted Zhang. This project is the lab project while I learn the 3d graphics.
</p>

The project implemented the following features:</p>
1)3D transformation.</p>
2)Lighting</p>
3)Texure mapping</p>
4)Z buffer</p>

The only api used is setpixel. It's a good demo project for 3d graphics learner. If you understand this project, it's trival
to learn opengl & directx.
